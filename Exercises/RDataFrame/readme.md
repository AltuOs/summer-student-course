# RDataFrame
Welcome to the exercises of the **RDataFrame** learning module! Here you will
find examples of HEP analyses using the `RDataFrame` tool. There are two types of examples:

* The tutorials `hsimple.*` process data that is stored remotely https://root.cern/files/tutorials/hsimple.root.
  The applications show a plot of the the sum of the *px* and *py* columns for
  every entry where *pz* is between -2 and 2.
* The `nanoAODDimuonAnalysis.*` examples show a plot of the invariant mass of
  muon pairs coming from real data of the CMS detector. They are readapted from
  https://root.cern/doc/master/df102__NanoAODDimuonAnalysis_8py.html.
